# seats

Implement a program for a kiosk that sells airline tickets.

A plane has 10 seats.

When the plane is empty a seat is $50.

For each seat sold the ticket price goes up 50%.

When a user types buy into the input, consider that seat sold and show the user the price of their seat.

The airline boss requests finer-grained pricing:

For the first half of the seats, the price goes up 30%.

For the second half it goes up by 50%.

The last seat is $91,000.

When outputing a message tell the user how many tickets are left before the price goes up.
