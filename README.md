Implement a program for a kiosk that sells airline tickets.

A plane has 10 seats.

When the plane is empty a seat is $50.

For each seat sold the ticket price goes up 5% over the original price.

When a user types `buy` into the input, consider that seat sold and show the user the price of their seat.

### further
The airline boss requests finer-grained pricing:

For the first half of the seats, the price goes up 3% over the original price.

For the second half it goes up by 5% over the original price.

The last seat is $91,000.

### further
When outputing a message tell the user how many tickets are left before the price bracket goes up.

### further
Change the pricing to increase by 3% and 5% over the *current* price of the ticket. (i.e., each ticket is some percentage more than the last)

### further
Implement a check of the input. Make sure to show the user a message when they type something invalid.
